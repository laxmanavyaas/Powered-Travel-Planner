# Powered-Travel-Planner

The AI-Powered Travel Planner is an innovative web application designed to assist users in planning their trips. Leveraging advanced AI, the application provides users with travel options, suggestions, and detailed information tailored to their specific needs. By integrating natural language processing (NLP) and AI-driven dialogue, it offers a user-friendly experience where users can easily query travel options between different locations.For demonstration purposes, the travel planner currently simulates travel data (prices and durations) for each mode of transport. In a fully deployed version, this information can be dynamically fetched from real-time APIs or databases for more accurate results.

Being a web-based application, users can access it across devices (smartphones, laptops, desktops), making it versatile and easy to use at any time.
